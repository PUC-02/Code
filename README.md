## How to deploy to Vercel (recommended for dark themed preview)

1. Create a Vercel account at https://vercel.com and connect your GitHub.

3. Import the repository in Vercel, set framework to "Vite".
4. Vercel will build and deploy automatically. The site will be available via a Vercel URL.

## Notes

- This demo uses client-side rendering and is **for research/education only**. No real-money transactions.
- If you want a ready preview without deploying, you can upload the project folder to CodeSandbox or StackBlitz (they support Vite).
- For improved mobile performance, reduce `Environment` usage and lower `dpr` in Canvas.
